# You're the AI - (Basic) Game
Simple game created as a way to learn Java.

## Introduction
(English not my first language)
As a somewhat-new self-taught programmer, I like to challenge myself.
This project in particular was based on a comment in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5xX6nRWDko).
I thought it could be interesting, so I tried to do it...and here it is (In progress at least).

## Technologies
* Java 8

## General Info
This is a game where the data is not entirely clear, and we're basically blind to the world, just like an AI.
Your goal is to go from the spawn point (Top-left corner) to the finish cell (Botom-right corner) without hitting any wall.

### Easy Mode
You're given a sonar, which tells you distances to the labyrinth's walls.
The sonar also shows your current rotation (Although your move's directions are not affected by it).

### Hard Mode
You're given a bunch of seemingly random numbers. Try to learn what they are and how to use them in order to reach your goal.
